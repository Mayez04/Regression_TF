# Regression with TensorFlow: Insurance-Charges-Prediction
This project aims to predict medical insurance charges based on various features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The dataset insurance.csv is used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess the data, and train machine learning models. The project compares the performance of a TensorFlow-based neural network and a Gradient Boosting Regressor, evaluating them using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score.
## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a TensorFlow-based regression model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow, including:

* Loading and exploring the dataset
* Data preprocessing
* Building a regression model using TensorFlow
* Training and evaluating the model
* Visualizing predictions and performance metrics

This project serves as a simple and clear template for anyone learning regression with deep learning.
