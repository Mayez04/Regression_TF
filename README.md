# Regression with TensorFlow

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a TensorFlow-based regression model implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate a complete machine learning workflow, including:

* Loading and exploring the dataset
* Data preprocessing
* Building a regression model using TensorFlow
* Training and evaluating the model
* Visualizing predictions and performance metrics

This project serves as a simple and clear template for anyone learning regression with deep learning.

## 🧰 Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (optional, for preprocessing)

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mayez04/Regression_TF.git
   cd Regression_TF
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "regression_with_tensorflow (1).ipynb"
   ```

   or open it through VS Code / JupyterLab.

3. Run all cells to:

   * Load and preprocess data
   * Build and compile the regression model
   * Train the model
   * Evaluate performance
   * Visualize results
